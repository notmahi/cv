\begin{detail}
Researching robot intelligence geared towards household settings -- diverse environments with multi-modal solutions to hundreds of possible tasks -- through learning from humans, modeling a prior from their behaviors, and harnessing those priors to learn in the real world.

\begin{detail}
Contributing to a unified model for understanding multiple modalities, like vision, language, video, audio, and integrate human behavior priors in such models to accelerate robot learning in the real world.

\begin{detail}
Built an implicit three-dimensional scene model using only an iPhone and pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLM) and Large Language Models (LLM)s. Such models can act as a geometric database and a source for truth for household robotics that supports positional queries and responses.

\begin{detail}
Built co-designing methods that accelerate formal verification of deep neural networks, designed differential privacy based defenses against backdoor attacks, investigated layerwise training of deep neural networks and detecting outliers and distribution shifts at test time.
