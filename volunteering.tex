Developed a Bayesian model of the COVID-19 reproduction rate, $R_0$, in every district of Bangladesh that is robust to the lack of testing and the poorly reported test data, which was used by the Bangladeshi cabinet to make governing decisions. Alongside top Bangladeshi epidemiologists, developed a technical report with simulations advocating for adoption of Rapid Antigen Testing which lead to the government's approval of said method.
